# Keras Tutorial - Originally presented at LIP Data Science School in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, Braga 2019: 
## Overview
This tutorial is designed to present neural networks from a practical, coding perspective and focus on their implementation via [Keras](https://keras.io/).
Several notebooks are found in the `notebooks` folder:
1. SGD_from_scratch uses a single neuron for trivial classification and regression tasks on pseudodata, implementing backpropagation and weight updates manually in Numpy. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/LIP_DSS_Keras_Tutorial_2019/blob/master/notebooks/0_SGD_from_scratch.ipynb)
1. Basic_Keras_Classification introduces Keras, using a non-trvial, but basic classification problem. Additionally it teaches the class-based approach for model building in Keras.

1. Basic_Keras_Regression uses the functional approach for model building in Keras to regress to a non-linear function.

1. Basic_Application_Exercise is an exercise introducing working with an example of tabular data and training a simple classifier.

1. Basic_Application_Exercise-Extended continues on from the previous exercise by looking at a more efficient treatment of categorical features, and how Keras Callbacks can be used to imporve training.

1. Basic_Application_Full-Exercise presents a regression example with no pre-written solutions beyond importing the data and dealing with a datetime column. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GilesStrong/LIP_DSS_Keras_Tutorial_2019/blob/master/notebooks/5_Basic_Application_Full-Exercise.ipynb)
1. Advanced_Application_Example draws on both functional and class-based model building approaches to build a classifier for a real-world example problem; event classifcation at the Large Hadron Collider. Additionally this notebook touches on some fundamental aspects of data science, including validation/test sets, data pre-processing, and model interpretation.
